<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally.
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

In order to run this project and leverage all of the intended features, the repository must be housed in a databricks workspace. In order to set up the folders properly, you must follow the following instructions:
1. [Configure your databricks/git credentials.](https://docs.databricks.com/en/repos/repos-setup.html)
2. [Create a git folder inside a databricks workspace using the repo URL.](https://docs.databricks.com/en/repos/git-operations-with-repos.html)
